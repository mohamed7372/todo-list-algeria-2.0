## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a **Task Management Application** using **React**, where users can manage their tasks across different categories (Business, Personal, etc.) while sharing state globally using **Context API** and **React Hooks**.

### 🛠️ Features:

- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks into categories like "Business" and "Personal".
- **Global State Management**: Utilize the Context API to manage tasks globally across components.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete or pending.
- **Dynamic Task Management**: Add and remove tasks dynamically with a real-time update of the task list.
- **Custom Hooks**: Improve code reusability and structure using custom hooks.
- **Clean UI**: A user-friendly interface with smooth interaction for task management.
